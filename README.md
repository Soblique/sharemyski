Please begin work with each other to identify ideas, research APIs, and create project designs.
You should expect to submit initial project idea proposals by the end of class today.

Feel free to begin coding as well, we have a lot of time.  I expect workflows, psuedocode, charts, or however else you can share your idea.  I just need something to look at to make sure that you are on the right track!
Please share also who will be focusing on what (Front-End, Back-End, Architecture, Planning, etc).  Your roles can be creative - you can jump around too but try to split up tasks!
